# Static-Node.js-and-Express-Site

In this project, i'll create a portfolio site to showcase the projects i've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page with contact info, and it will show off and detail at least five projects from this Techdegree.

i'll use Node.js and Express to:

* Import the required dependencies
* Link the JSON with the Pug templates
* Set up routes to handle requests
* Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
* Handle errors
* Set up a server to serve the project
